# expand and unexpand

## Lesson Content

In our lesson on the cut command, we had our sample.txt file that contained a tab. Normally TABs would usually show a noticeable difference but some text files don't show that well enough. Having TABs in a text file may not be the desired spacing you want. To change your TABs to spaces, use the expand command. 

<pre>$ expand sample.txt</pre>

Now that file has all TABs converted to spaces.

Similar to expand, we can also convert spaces to TABS with the unexpand command: 

<pre>$ unexpand sample.txt</pre>
