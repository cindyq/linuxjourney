## Lesson Content

We’re almost done navigating files, but first let’s learn how to read a file. A simple command to use is the cat command, short for concatenate, it not only displays file contents but it can combine multiple files and show you the output of them. 

<pre>$ cat dogfile birdfile</pre>
