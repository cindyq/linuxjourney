# Vim Saving and Exiting

## Lesson Content

Now that you've done your editing it's time to actually save and quit out of vim: 

<ul>
<li>:w - writes or saves the file</li>
<li>:q - quit out of vim</li>
<li>:wq - write and then quit</li>
<li>:q! - quit out of vim without saving the file</li>
<li>ZZ - equivalent of :wq, but one character faster</li>

<li>u - undo your last action</li>
<li>Ctrl-r - redo your last action</li>
</ul>

You may not think ZZ is necessary, but you'll eventually see that your fingers may tend to lean towards this rather than :wq.
