# Setgid

## Lesson Content

Similar to the set user ID permission bit, there is a set group ID (SGID) permission bit. This bit allows a program to run as if it was a member of that group. 

Let's look at one example: 

<pre>$ ls -l /usr/bin/wall
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root tty 19024 Dec 14 11:45 /usr/bin/wall
</pre>

We can see now that the permission bit is in the group permission set. 

<b>Modifying SGID</b>

<pre>$ sudo chmod g+s myfile
$ sudo chmod 2555 myfile
</pre>

The numerical representation for SGID is 2.
